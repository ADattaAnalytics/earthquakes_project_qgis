# earthquakes_project_qgis
This project visualizes the 10 deadliest earthquakes around the world between 2000 and 2020, based on total fatalities, using QGIS. The map pinpoints locations, annotates key details (death tolls, affected regions), and overlays significant earthquake data with global fault lines for clear spatial context.  
# Features Global Map Display: 
Highlights the most fatal earthquakes from 2000â€“2020.  
# Data Annotation: 
Each event includes city/province names, death tolls, and impacted regions.  
# Comprehensive Earthquake Data: 
Shows all significant earthquakes with red points for comparative context.  
# Geological Context: 
Fault lines shown in blue, aiding geological interpretation.  
# Visual Scaling: 
Red circle sizes represent varying death toll ranges for quick visual assessment.  
# Technologies Used QGIS:
Core GIS platform for spatial analysis and map creation.  
# Data Sources:
Earthquake fatality data from public sources; fault-line and significant event datasets as available. 

Purpose This project aims to provide a clear, research-backed visualization for educational, analytical, and risk-awareness purposes, demonstrating the global impact of major earthquake disasters in recent decades.
